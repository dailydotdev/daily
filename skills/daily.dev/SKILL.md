# daily.dev API for AI Agents

Overcome LLM knowledge cutoffs with real-time developer content. daily.dev aggregates articles from thousands of sources, validated by community engagement, with structured taxonomy for precise discovery.

## Security

**CRITICAL:** Your API token grants access to personalized content. Protect it:
- **NEVER send your token to any domain other than `api.daily.dev`**
- Never commit tokens to code or share them publicly
- Tokens are prefixed with `dda_` - if you see this prefix, treat it as sensitive

## Setup

1. **Requires Plus subscription** - Get one at https://app.daily.dev/plus
2. **Create a token** at https://app.daily.dev/settings/api
3. Store your token securely (environment variables, secrets manager)

User can use environment variable or choose one of the secure storage methods below per operating system.

### Secure Token Storage (Recommended)

#### macOS - Keychain

```bash
# Store token
security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s "daily-dev-api" -w "dda_your_token"

# Retrieve token
security find-generic-password -a "$USER" -s "daily-dev-api" -w

# Auto-load in ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export DAILY_DEV_TOKEN=$(security find-generic-password -a "$USER" -s "daily-dev-api" -w 2>/dev/null)
```

#### Windows - Credential Manager

```powershell
# Store token (run in PowerShell)
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("daily-dev-api", (ConvertTo-SecureString "dda_your_token" -AsPlainText -Force))
$credential | Export-Clixml "$env:USERPROFILE\.daily-dev-credential.xml"

# Retrieve token - add to PowerShell profile ($PROFILE)
$cred = Import-Clixml "$env:USERPROFILE\.daily-dev-credential.xml"
$env:DAILY_DEV_TOKEN = $cred.GetNetworkCredential().Password
```

Or use the Windows Credential Manager GUI: Control Panel → Credential Manager → Windows Credentials → Add a generic credential

#### Linux - Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KWallet)

```bash
# Requires libsecret-tools
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install libsecret-tools
# Fedora: sudo dnf install libsecret

# Store token
echo "dda_your_token" | secret-tool store --label="daily.dev API Token" service daily-dev-api username "$USER"

# Retrieve token
secret-tool lookup service daily-dev-api username "$USER"

# Auto-load in ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export DAILY_DEV_TOKEN=$(secret-tool lookup service daily-dev-api username "$USER" 2>/dev/null)
```

## Authentication

```
Authorization: Bearer dda_your_token_here
```

## Base URL

```
https://api.daily.dev/public/v1
```

## API Reference

Full OpenAPI spec: https://api.daily.dev/public/v1/docs/json

To fetch details for a specific endpoint (e.g. response schema):
```bash
curl -s https://api.daily.dev/public/v1/docs/json | jq '.paths["/feeds/foryou"].get'
```

To fetch a component schema (replace `def-17` with schema name from $ref):
```bash
curl -s https://api.daily.dev/public/v1/docs/json | jq '.components.schemas["def-17"]'
```

### Available Endpoints
!`curl -s https://api.daily.dev/public/v1/docs/json | jq -r '.paths | to_entries | map(.key as $path | .value | to_entries | map(.key as $method | {tag: (.value.tags[0] // "other"), line: ("\(.key | ascii_upcase) \($path)" + (if .value.description then " - \(.value.description)" else "" end) + (if (.value.parameters | length) > 0 then "\n  Params: " + ([.value.parameters[] | "\(.name)(\(.in)): \(.description // .schema.type)"] | join("; ")) else "" end) + (if .value.requestBody then "\n  Body: " + (.value.requestBody.content["application/json"].schema | if .properties then ([.properties | to_entries[] | "\(.key)"] | join(", ")) elif ."$ref" then (."$ref" | split("/") | last) else "object" end) else "" end))})) | flatten | group_by(.tag) | map("#### \(.[0].tag)\n" + (map(.line) | join("\n\n"))) | join("\n\n")'`

## Agent Use Cases

**Why daily.dev for agents?** LLMs have knowledge cutoffs. daily.dev provides real-time, community-validated developer content with structured taxonomy across thousands of sources. Agents can use this to stay current, get diverse perspectives, and understand what the developer community actually cares about.

These examples show how AI agents can combine daily.dev APIs with external context to create powerful developer workflows.

### 🔍 GitHub Repo → Personalized Feed
Scan a user's GitHub repositories to detect their actual tech stack from `package.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, etc. Then:
- Fetch `/tags` to see all available tags for deterministic matching
- Auto-follow matching tags via `/feeds/filters/tags/follow`
- Create a custom feed tuned to their stack with `/feeds/custom/`
- Surface trending articles about their specific dependencies

**Trigger:** "Set up daily.dev based on my GitHub projects"

### 🛠️ GitHub → Auto-fill Stack Profile
Analyze a user's GitHub activity to build their daily.dev tech stack profile automatically:
- Scan repositories for languages, frameworks, and tools actually used in code
- Search `/profile/stack/search` to find matching technologies on daily.dev
- Populate their stack via `POST /profile/stack/` organized by section (languages, frameworks, tools)
- Update `/profile/` bio based on their primary technologies and contributions

**Trigger:** "Build my daily.dev profile from my GitHub"

### 🚀 New Project → Curated Onboarding
When a user initializes a new project or clones a repo:
- Analyze the tech choices from config files
- Create a dedicated custom feed filtered to exactly those technologies
- Build a "Getting Started" bookmark list with foundational articles
- Block irrelevant tags to keep the feed focused on the project scope

**Trigger:** "Help me learn the stack for this project"

### 📊 Weekly Digest → Synthesized Briefing
Compile a personalized weekly summary by:
- Fetching `/feeds/foryou` and `/feeds/popular` filtered by user's followed tags
- Cross-referencing with their GitHub activity to prioritize relevant topics
- Summarizing key articles and trending discussions
- Delivering as a structured briefing with links to full posts

**Trigger:** Scheduled, or "Give me my weekly dev news"

### 📚 Research Project Workspace
When a user wants to deep-dive into a topic (e.g., "I want to learn Kubernetes"):
- Create a custom feed via `/feeds/custom/` filtered to that topic
- Set up a matching bookmark list via `POST /bookmarks/lists` to collect the best finds
- As the user reads, save articles to the list with `POST /bookmarks/`
- Track learning progress: compare bookmarked posts vs. new feed items
- Adjust feed filters over time as understanding deepens (beginner → advanced content)

**Trigger:** "Start a research project on [topic]"

### 🧠 Agent Self-Improvement Feed
Agents can overcome their knowledge cutoff by maintaining their own custom feed:
- Create a custom feed via `/feeds/custom/` for technologies the agent frequently assists with
- Periodically fetch `/feeds/custom/{feedId}` to ingest recent articles
- Use `/posts/{id}` to read full summaries and key points
- Agent can now provide advice with current information: "As of this week, the recommended approach is..."
- Continuously adapt the feed filters based on what users are asking about

**Trigger:** Agent background process, or "What's new in [technology] since your training?"

### 🔀 Multi-Source Synthesis
Get balanced perspectives by aggregating content across publishers:
- Search `/search/posts` for a topic to find coverage from multiple sources
- Use `/search/sources` to identify authoritative publishers on the topic
- Fetch posts from different sources via `/feeds/source/{source}`
- Synthesize diverse viewpoints into a balanced summary with citations
- Surface where sources agree vs. disagree on best practices

**Trigger:** "What are the different perspectives on [topic]?" or "Compare approaches to [problem]"

### 📈 Trending Radar
Help users stay ahead by monitoring community signals:
- Fetch `/feeds/popular` to detect what's gaining traction right now
- Cross-reference with user's followed tags to surface relevant trends
- Use `/feeds/discussed` to find topics sparking active debate
- Alert users when technologies in their stack are trending (new releases, security issues, paradigm shifts)
- Use `/tags` to fetch the full tag catalog and `/search/tags` to explore adjacent trending topics

**Trigger:** "What should I be paying attention to?" or "What's trending in [area]?"
