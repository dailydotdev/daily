## 🚀 Running Daily Locally

Let's setup Daily locally. First you need to setup the services required to run the Daily applications, then you can run the application you want. Follow up the setups below to quickly get started.

## ⚙️ Setting Up Daily Services

### → STEP #0

* Go through the [projects description](#-daily-projects) and [the architecture](#-architecture) to familiarize yourself with the system and its components.
* Make sure Docker is installed on your machine. Take a look at the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/#desktop) for installation. After installation, run the following command in your terminal for a double check.

```sh
docker -v
# Docker version 18.09.2, build 6247962     // Expected result
```

### → STEP #1

The first step is to **create a network**, so the different services of Daily can communicate with each other.

> Daily services are fully dockerized and publicly available on a Google Cloud Registry (GCR) repository. We are going to use them to complete the setup.

Run the following command to create a network. It will be instant. We will use the name of the network, `daily` in this case, to connect our services.

```sh
docker network create daily

# 465691b49f0ba36020f0533e174c019382e82c4a827432132d0e045282dfc995     // Expected result
```

### → STEP #2

Second step in this process is to start a MySQL instance with appropriate databases. We are going to use our database service for this purpose.

We will grab the image from GCR, run it, and connect to our network `daily`. It exposes port `3306` so you can use any MySQL client to connect and inspect the data. The root user is `root` and password is `12345`.

Run the following command to accomplish this task:

```sh
docker run -d --name daily-mysql -p 3306:3306 --network daily gcr.io/daily-ops/mysql
```
The command will take a while depending upon your internet speed. See the GIF to follow up.

![Setting up MySQL](/assets/setting&#32;up&#32;/starting&#32;sql&#32;server.gif)

### → STEP #3

The next step is to run the Daily Gateway service and connect it with our `daily` network. This service exposes port `4000 ` when your run it.

To start Daily Gateway service, run the following command in your terminal. Again, depending upon your internet connection, it may take a while.

```sh
docker run -d --name daily-gateway -p 4000:4000 --network daily -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=12345 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=gateway -e MYSQL_HOST=daily-mysql -e COOKIES_DOMAIN=localhost -e COOKIES_KEY=topsecret -e GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=7b514cee17923d0acedc -e GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=064d875c7b370d271be839242538c87ab8bb6f92 -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=750405661228-fmeg35uuaopbcnc4c6m6g51755s355bm.apps.googleusercontent.com -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=MMv_wZAS6Etoleg-sn__BlDC -e URL_PREFIX=http://localhost:4000 -e JWT_SECRET='|r+.2!!!.Qf_-|63*%.D' -e JWT_AUDIENCE='Daily Staging' -e JWT_ISSUER='Daily API Staging' -e CORS_ORIGIN='http://,chrome-extension://,moz-extension://' -e PORT=4000 -e API_URL=http://daily-api:5000 -e API_SECRET=topsecret gcr.io/daily-ops/daily-gateway
```

> The OAuth credentials are for our staging environment and don't provide any real Daily user information.

Yes, we have a GIF for you showing how it should go ideally.

![Setting up Daily Gateway](/assets/setting&#32;up&#32;/setting&#32;gateway&#32;service.gif)

### → STEP #4

We have MySQL service in running with Daily gateway service. Next, we need to run the Daily API Service and connect it to our network. It exposes port `5000`.

Run the following command your terminal to start it.

```sh
docker run -d --name daily-api -p 5000:5000 --network daily -e DEFAULT_IMAGE_URL=https://storage.cloud.google.com/devkit-assets/placeholder.jpg -e DEFAULT_IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER='data:image/jpg;base64,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' -e DEFAULT_IMAGE_RATIO=1.7 -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=12345 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=devkit -e MYSQL_HOST=daily-mysql -e URL_PREFIX=http://localhost:4000 -e PORT=5000 -e GATEWAY_URL=http://daily-gateway:4000 -e GATEWAY_SECRET=topsecret gcr.io/daily-ops/daily-api
```

Ideally, this is how it should work:

![Setting up Daily API](/assets/setting&#32;up&#32;/setting&#32;daily&#32;api&#32;service.gif)

### → STEP #5

Last step is to populate your database using the seed data. We use `knex.js` for this purpose. All you need to do is, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
docker exec daily-api npx knex seed:run

# npx: installed 160 in 10.92s     // Expected result
# Using environment: development
# Ran 1 seed files
```


That's it! 🥂

Now you have all the required services running. Each project's repo explains what services are needed and how to get started with them.

> Note that currently not all services are ready (or needed) for local environment so Daily Redirector and Daily Monetization services are not available for you.
>
> It means that if you click on an article you will get error 404 and that you will not see ads on your local environment.

## 🎨 Setting Up Daily Apps

Now, let's quickly setup Daily chrome extension to elaborate how you can setup each Daily application.

### → STEP #1

Clone the [daily-apps](https://github.com/dailydotdev/daily-apps) repo and run the following commands in your terminal to bootstrap.

Yes, we use `lerna` for this purpose.

```sh
npx lerna bootstrap

# npx: installed 698 in 89.279s     // Expected result
# ...
# lerna success Bootstrapped 4 packages

npx lerna run build

# Done in 29.19s.     // Expected result
# lerna success run Ran npm script 'build' in 4 packages in 48.5s:
# lerna success - @daily/components
# lerna success - @daily/extension
# lerna success - @daily/moderator
# lerna success - @daily/services
```
### → STEP #2

Go to `packages/extension` in the `daily-apps` folder. Run the following command to start it in development mode. It will watch for all the file changes and generate the output in `dist` folder.

```sh
yarn serve

# ...
# DONE  Build complete. Watching for changes...      // Expected result
```
### → STEP #3

By now, you will have unpacked Daily extension in your `dist` folder. Follow the steps listed below to load the extension.

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` path in your Chrome browser.
2. Enable `Developer mode` from the top right section.
3. Click on `Load Unpack` button and select your `dist` folder.

That's it! Your extension has been loaded in your browser. Happy hacking! ✌️
