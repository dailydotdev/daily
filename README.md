## 📯 Philosophy

We, as developers, spend a lot of time looking for valuable articles and blog posts. We believe that searching for content isn't a thing developers should do anymore. It's hard to catch up with all the latest happenings — coz it's spread on so many blogs and consumes tons of time.

That's why we built daily.dev, to help you:

* 👨‍💻 Stay up-to-date
* 🕒 Save time
* 📰 Discover articles in one click

## 🚀 Running daily.dev Locally

Let's setup daily.dev locally. First you need to setup the services required to run the daily.dev applications, then you can run the application you want. Follow up the setups below to quickly get started.

## ⚙️ Setting Up Daily Services

You can go the easy way by using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/dailydotdev/apps/) or follow the instructions below.

### → STEP #0

* Go through the [projects description](#-daily-projects) and [the architecture](#-architecture) to familiarize yourself with the system and its components.
* Make sure docker-compose is installed on your machine. Take a look at the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for installation. After installation, run the following command in your terminal for a double check.

```sh
docker-compose -v
# docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c     // Expected result
```

### → STEP #1

Clone the [apps](https://github.com/dailydotdev/apps) repo.

### → STEP #2

> Daily services are fully dockerized and publicly available on a Google Cloud Registry (GCR) repository. We are going to use them!

The first step is to **pull and run the docker images**, thanks to docker-compose network and environment variables are preconfigured and ready-to-go.

Navigate to the cloned repository and make sure Docker is running on your machine. After that run the following command to run all daily services:

```sh
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```

The command will take a while depending upon your internet speed.

### → STEP #3

Now we need to apply the migrations on our databases so they will have the latest schema:

```sh
docker exec apps_daily-api_1 node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:run

# ... // Expected result
# Migration PostToc1623847855158 has been executed successfully.
# query: COMMIT

docker exec apps_daily-gateway_1 yarn run db:migrate:latest

# Using environment: development   // Expected result
# Batch 1 run: 23 migrations
# Done in 1.57s.
```

### → STEP #4

The last step is to populate your database using the seed data. All you need to do is, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
docker exec apps_daily-api_1 node bin/import.js

# importing Source              // Expected result
# importing Post
# importing Keyword
# importing PostKeyword
# done
```


That's it! 🥂

Now you have all the required services running. Each project's repo explains what services are needed and how to get started with them.

> Note that currently, not all services are ready (or needed) for local environment so Daily Redirector and Daily Monetization services are not available for you.
>
> It means that if you click on an article you will get error 404 and that you will not see ads on your local environment.

## 🎨 Setting Up Daily Apps

Now, let's quickly set up daily.dev apps.

### → STEP #1

Run the following commands in your terminal to bootstrap.

Yes, we use `lerna` for this purpose.

```sh
npm i -g lerna
lerna bootstrap

# ...     // Expected result
# lerna success Bootstrapped 5 packages
```
### → STEP #2

Go to `packages/webapp` in the `apps` folder. Run the following command to start the webapp in development mode. It will watch for all the file changes.

```sh
npm run dev
```
### → STEP #3

Go to `packages/extension` in the `apps` folder. Run the following command to start the extension in development mode. It will watch for all the file changes and generate the output in `dist` folder.

```sh
npm run dev:chrome
```
### → STEP #4

By now, you will have unpacked daily.dev extension in your `dist` folder. Follow the steps listed below to load the extension.

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` path in your Chrome browser.
2. Enable `Developer mode` from the top right section.
3. Click on `Load Unpack` button and select your `dist` folder.

That's it! Your extension has been loaded in your browser. Happy hacking! ✌️
