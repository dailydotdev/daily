## 📯 Philosophy

We, as developers, spend a lot of time looking for valuable articles and blog posts. We believe that searching for content isn't a thing developers should do anymore. It's hard to catch up with all the latest happenings — coz it's spread on so many blogs and consumes tons of time.

That's why built daily.dev, to help you:

* 👨‍💻 Stay up-to-date
* ⏳Save time
* 📰 Discover articles in one click

## 🚀 Running daily.dev Locally

Let's setup daily.dev locally. First you need to setup the services required to run the daily.dev applications, then you can run the application you want. Follow up the setups below to quickly get started.

## ⚙️ Setting Up Daily Services

### → STEP #0

* Go through the [projects description](#-daily-projects) and [the architecture](#-architecture) to familiarize yourself with the system and its components.
* Make sure docker-compose is installed on your machine. Take a look at the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for installation. After installation, run the following command in your terminal for a double check.

```sh
docker-compose -v
# docker-compose version 1.25.5, build 8a1c60f6     // Expected result
```

### → STEP #1

Clone the [daily-apps](https://github.com/dailydotdev/daily-apps) repo

### → STEP #2

> Daily services are fully dockerized and publicly available on a Google Cloud Registry (GCR) repository. We are going to use them!

The first step is to **pull and run the docker images**, thanks to docker-compose network and environment variables are preconfigured and ready to-go.

Run the following command to accomplish this task:

```sh
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```

The command will take a while depending upon your internet speed. See the GIF to follow up.
![Setting up Daily Services](/assets/setting&#32;up/docker-compose-up.gif)

### → STEP #3

Last step is to populate your database using the seed data. All you need to do is, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
docker exec daily-apps_daily-api_1 node bin/import.js

# importing Source              // Expected result
# importing SourceDisplay
# importing Post
# importing PostTag
# importing TagCount
# importing Notification
# done
```


That's it! 🥂

Now you have all the required services running. Each project's repo explains what services are needed and how to get started with them.

> Note that currently not all services are ready (or needed) for local environment so Daily Redirector and Daily Monetization services are not available for you.
>
> It means that if you click on an article you will get error 404 and that you will not see ads on your local environment.

## 🎨 Setting Up Daily Apps

Now, let's quickly setup daily.dev chrome extension to elaborate how you can setup each daily.dev application.

### → STEP #1

Run the following commands in your terminal to bootstrap.

Yes, we use `lerna` for this purpose.

```sh
npx lerna bootstrap

# npx: installed 698 in 89.279s     // Expected result
# ...
# lerna success Bootstrapped 4 packages

npx lerna run build

# Done in 29.19s.     // Expected result
# lerna success run Ran npm script 'build' in 4 packages in 48.5s:
# lerna success - @daily/components
# lerna success - @daily/extension
# lerna success - @daily/moderator
# lerna success - @daily/services
```
### → STEP #2

Go to `packages/extension` in the `daily-apps` folder. Run the following command to start it in development mode. It will watch for all the file changes and generate the output in `dist` folder.

```sh
yarn serve

# ...
# DONE  Build complete. Watching for changes...      // Expected result
```
### → STEP #3

By now, you will have unpacked daily.dev extension in your `dist` folder. Follow the steps listed below to load the extension.

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` path in your Chrome browser.
2. Enable `Developer mode` from the top right section.
3. Click on `Load Unpack` button and select your `dist` folder.

That's it! Your extension has been loaded in your browser. Happy hacking! ✌️

For Firefox, you can follow [this guide](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/). Similarly, you can run all the other daily.dev apps. Each app has a readme file in its repo to help you get started.
