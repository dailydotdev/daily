## 📯 Philosophy

We recognize that developers today have the greatest power as a professional group to drive change and affect lives of billions. There are many platforms that provide developers with tools that serve to their success, or the goals of their workplace, but daily.dev is by-design for developers themselves. 

We, as developers, know how challenging it is to grow professionally with so much going on, and that's why we built daily.dev - to make it easy for us to navigate abundance of content and discover all the knowledge they need with zero effort.

You can use daily.dev to:

* 👨‍💻 Learn and stay up-to-date
* 🙌 Interact based on the latest trends in our ecosystem
* 🚀 Collaborate with other developers you know and appreciate

## 🌲 daily.dev projects

## 🚀 Running daily.dev locally

Let's setup daily.dev locally. First, you need to setup the services required to run the daily.dev applications, then you can run the application you want. Follow up the setups below to quickly get started.

## ⚙️ Setting Up Daily Services

You can go the easy way by using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/dailydotdev/apps/) or follow the instructions below.

### → STEP #0

* Make sure docker-compose is installed on your machine. Take a look at the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for installation. After installation, run the following command in your terminal for a double check.

```sh
docker compose version
# Docker Compose version v2.10.0 // Expected result
```

### → STEP #1

Clone the [apps](https://github.com/dailydotdev/apps) repo.

### → STEP #2

> daily.dev services are fully dockerized and publicly available on a Google Cloud Registry (GCR) repository. We are going to use them!

The first step is to **pull and run the docker images**. Thanks to docker-compose, network and environment variables are preconfigured and ready to go.

Navigate to the cloned repository and make sure Docker is running on your machine. After that run the following command to run all daily services:

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```

The command will take a while depending on your internet speed.

### → STEP #3

Now we need to apply the migrations on our databases so they will have the latest schema:

```sh
docker exec apps-daily-api-1 node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:run -d src/data-source.js

# ... // Expected result
# Migration PostToc1623847855158 has been executed successfully.
# query: COMMIT
```

### → STEP #4

The last step is to populate your database using the seed data. All you need to do is, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
docker exec apps-daily-api-1 node bin/import.js

# importing Source              // Expected result
# importing Post
# importing Keyword
# importing PostKeyword
# done
```


That's it! 🍻

Now, you have all the required services running. Each project's repo explains what services are needed and how to get started with them.

> Note that currently, not all services are ready (or needed) for local environment so Daily Redirector and Daily Monetization services are not available for you.
>
> It means that if you click on an article you will get error 404 and that you will not see ads on your local environment.

## 🎨 Setting Up Daily Apps

Now, let's quickly set up daily.dev apps.

### → STEP #1

Run the following commands in your terminal to bootstrap.

Yes, we use `lerna` for this purpose.

```sh
npm i -g lerna
lerna bootstrap

# ...     // Expected result
# lerna success Bootstrapped 5 packages
```
### → STEP #2

Go to `packages/webapp` in the `apps` folder. Run the following command to start the webapp in development mode. It will watch for all the file changes.

```sh
npm run dev
```
### → STEP #3

Go to `packages/extension` in the `apps` folder. Run the following command to start the extension in development mode. It will watch for all the file changes and generate the output in `dist` folder.

```sh
npm run dev:chrome
```
### → STEP #4

By now, you will have unpacked daily.dev extension in your `dist` folder. Follow the steps listed below to load the extension.

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` path in your Chrome browser.
2. Enable `Developer mode` from the top right section.
3. Click on `Load Unpack` button and select your `dist` folder.

That's it! Your extension has been loaded in your browser. Happy hacking! ✌️
