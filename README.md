## Projects 

Daily might look pretty simple on the surface but actually it is powered by several services, some might be big and legacy and other micro and easy to maintain. We would like to guide you through the different repositories so you can get by the codebase.

### Community & Docs

* [daily](https://github.com/dailynowco/daily) - This is the repository you are currently at and it is actually the repository with overall documentation, community ideas, suggestions and whatnot.

### Frontend

* [daily-apps](https://github.com/dailynowco/daily-apps) - Monorepo with all the frontend related projects since Daily 2.0, our Vue components library, API encapsulation library, obviously Daily extension and others.
* [daily-go](https://github.com/dailynowco/daily-go) - Our Daily Go webapp, with a story like interface (called toilet mode) and user's bookmarks.

### Backend

* [daily-api](https://github.com/dailynowco/daily-api) - Started as a monolith API service and slowly has been split apart to different services. Currently the target domain is to manage content related data such as posts, feeds, tags, etc.
* [daily-redirector](https://github.com/dailynowco/daily-redirector) - Service for redirecting visitors from Daily custom links to the original link.
* [daily-gateway](https://github.com/dailynowco/daily-gateway) - API gateway which receives all traffic and forward it to the relevant services after authenticating and authorizing the request.
* [daily-monetization](https://github.com/dailynowco/daily-monetization) - Serving ads from different providers including CodeFund, BuySellAds and self-hosted campaigns.
* [daily-functions](https://github.com/dailynowco/daily-functions) - Monorepo with Cloud Functions which mostly take care of ingesting new content but also web push and others.

## Architecture

## Tech Stack

We use Vue for web application development and Netlify for hosting them.
Backend wise most of the services and cloud functions are written in Node and some minor services are written in Go (wanted to learn Go, perfect chance üòú). Everything is Docker-based and deployed to the almighty Kubernetes cluster with Helm charts.
MySQL is the database which powers everything and Google Pub/Sub is used for inter-service communitcation.
Lastly, we use Google's Cloud Build for CI/CD but a migration to a more open source friendly platform is on the roadmap (Travis, CircleCI, or whatever).
